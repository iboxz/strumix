              Strutop RM650 is supplied as a ready to use blend of dry powders,
              which requires only the addition of clean water to produce a
              highly consistent cementitious repair mortar suitable for
              structural concrete and masonry repairs. Strutop RM650 contains no
              metallic aggregate and is chloride free. Strutop RM650 is
              formulated for sprayed or trowelled applications, in thicknesses
              up to 30 mm in one layer by hand application. Greater thicknesses
              can be achieved when spray applied.

            <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Preparation: It is essential that the substrate to be repaired
                is sound, clean and free of all contamination. The damaged areas
                of concrete to be removed must be clearly identified. The
                Perimeter of the area should be saw cut to a depth of 10 mm and
                the edges cut as neatly as possible keeping the sides square.
                Feather-edging is not permitted and a minimum thickness of 10 mm
                must be maintained over the whole area. The substrate should be
                prepared to provide a rough surface having at least 5 mm
                amplitude at 20 mm frequency. If unsound or oil contaminated
                concrete is found to extend beyond the pre-marked area, consult
                the engineer in charge. Subject to approval cut back to clean
                sound concrete. If reinforcement is corroded, ensure that the
                back of the steel has been exposed. Reinforcement should have
                all rust removed by the use of power tools, abrasive basting
                (wet or dry) or wire brushing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Water Saturation: Thoroughly saturate the surface of the
                concrete to provide a saturated surface dry condition. Poor
                quality concrete may require soaking for a significant length of
                time. Any surface water should be removed using an oil free
                compressed air-jet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mixing: Strutop RM650 should be mixed mechanically with a Heavy
                Duty, slow speed drill or a forced action mixer fitted. Add 3
                liters of water into a suitably sized mixing vessel for full bag
                mixing. Do not use part-bags. It is suggested that the
                temperature of the water should not exceed 20°C, so that the
                temperature of the final mixed material is not greater than
                30°C. With the mixer in action, add one full bag of Strutop
                RM650 and mix for 3 - 5 minutes, until the mix becomes fully
                homogeneous. (Water levels may be adjusted to allow good spray
                techniques between 3 & 3.5 liters per bag)
              </li>
              <li>
                Application: After mixing, Strutop RM650 can be sprayed or
                trowel applied. When applying by hand, Strutop RM650 must be
                forced tightly into the substrate to ensure intimate contact
                with the pre-wetted substrate. Leveling and initial finishing
                should be carried using a wooden or plastic float. Final
                finishing should be carried out using a steel float. When the
                material has stiffened to the point where finger pressure
                lightly marks the surface, a final firm troweling should be
                given using a steel float.
              </li>
              <li>
                Curing: Strutop RM650 demands good curing. Particular care is
                required in hot/windy conditions. Curing is to be commenced
                immediately either by applying a single coat of Strubond@ Acro7
                or by covering the work with plastic sheet fixed over wet
                hessian and taped at all edges.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleaning: Strutop RM650 should be removed from tools and
                equipment with clean water immediately after use.

            <h3>Packaging & Storage</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Packaging: Strutop RM650 is available in 25 kg bags.</li>
              <li>
                Storage: Strutop RM650 has a minimum shelf life of 12 months at
                20°C if kept in a dry store in the original, unopened packs. The
                shelf life will be reduced at higher ambient temperatures.

            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
            <p>
              Strutop RM650 is alkaline and should not come into contact with
              skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of dust during mixing. Gloves,
              goggles and dust mask should be worn. If contact with skin occurs,
              wash with water. Splashes to eyes should be washed immediately
              with plenty of clean water and medical advice sought.
