            <p>
              Strufloor S70 concrete densifier and chemical hardener compound is
              a ready-to-use, colorless liquid, formulated with chemically
              reactive raw materials to harden and dustproof concrete. When
              properly applied, Strufloor S70 will offer substantial improvement
              in abrasion and chemical resistance and will significantly improve
              the durability of the concrete surface when compared to untreated
              concrete. As Strufloor S70 is applied and penetrates into the
              concrete surface, a chemical reaction takes place, producing a
              byproduct that fills in the pores of the concrete. This process
              produces a substantially denser concrete surface with enhanced
              durability. In addition to the densifying and hardening action,
              Strufloor S70 also solidifies the concrete, eliminating dusting
              and pitting.

            <h3>Uses</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strufloor S70 is recommended for use wherever hardened,
                dustproofed, and improved chemical and abrasion resistant
                surfaces are required. Ideal applications include floors in
                industrial plants and warehouses, storage silos, sewage plants,
                chemical processing facilities, refineries, and heavy pedestrian
                floor traffic areas, such as civic centers, sports arenas,
                stadiums, hospitals, airports, and museums. Strufloor S70 can
                successfully be used in conjunction with shake-on hardeners.

                <p>
                  Strufloor S70 does not fall into the hazard classifications of
                  current regulations. However, it should not be swallowed or
                  allowed to come into contact with skin and eyes. Suitable
                  protective gloves and goggles should be worn. Splashes on the
                  skin should be removed with water. In case of contact with
                  eyes rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical
                  advice. If swallowed seek medical attention immediately - do
                  not induce vomiting.

            <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Preparation: Fresh Concrete - On newly placed concrete,
                Strufloor S70 can be applied, as you would a cure, after final
                troweling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Existing (Old) Concrete - Surface should be clean and
                structurally sound. Remove all residues, curing compounds, oils,
                sealers, contaminants and laitance before applying Strufloor
                S70. Fill and repair all holes, cracks and deteriorated areas
                that have been removed to sound concrete.
              </li>
              <li>
                Application: Fresh Concrete - Apply undiluted Strufloor S70 at
                approximately 5 m²/litr using a low-pressure sprayer or by
                spreading evenly with a soft-bristled broom. Do not allow
                material to puddle on the surface. No further application steps
                are required for fresh concrete.
              </li>
              <li>
                Existing (Old) Concrete - Saturate the surface with undiluted
                Strufloor S70 by sprayer, squeegee or broom. Keep the surface
                wet with Strufloor S70 for a minimum of 30 minutes. (A range of
                30-60 minutes may be required depending on temperature and
                conditions.) NOTE: Pay particular attention to porous and/or dry
                areas. These areas must be kept wet at all times with Strufloor
                S70. Once the surface begins to gel and becomes slippery,
                immediately spray the surface with a light water mist. Scrub the
                surface with a broom or mechanical scrubber to increase the
                penetration of the Strufloor S70. Continue to work the Strufloor
                S70 into the surface for another 5-10 minutes or until Strufloor
                S70 becomes gelled and slippery for a second time. At this time,
                thoroughly flush the surface with water. During the flushing
                process, agitate the surface with a broom to aid in removal of
                the excess Strufloor S70. Remove all excess material with a mop
                or squeegee. Thoroughly squeegee the surface dry. If there are
                slippery patches, this is an indication that there is still
                excess Strufloor S70 present. These areas should be re-flushed
                and squeegeed again until the entire surface is dry. (Extremely
                porous surfaces may require a second application.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Burnishing: Strufloor S70 can be burnished to a high sheen on
                steel trowel concrete floors. A high-speed burnisher (2000-2200
                rpm) with appropriate maintenance pad is needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Drying Time: 2 – 4 hours. Strufloor S70 dries very quickly on
                new, virgin concrete. Drying times may be extended on existing
                (old) concrete due to surface conditions. Restrict foot traffic
                for at least four hours; 12 hours is preferable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleaning: While still wet, equipment may be cleaned quickly and
                easily with soap and water. Do not allow Strufloor S70 to dry
                before flushing excess from surfaces.

              Strufloor S70 does not fall into the hazard classifications of
              current regulations. However, it should not be swallowed or
              allowed to come into contact with skin and eyes. Suitable
              protective gloves and goggles should be worn. Splashes on the skin
              should be removed with water. In case of contact with eyes rinse
              immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice. If
              swallowed seek medical attention immediately - do not induce
              vomiting.
