              Strucure SW50 water based concrete curing compound is based on a
              silicate salts emulsion. It is supplied as a white emulsion.
              Strucure SW50 is also available in a white pigmented version. It
              contains a white pigment based on titanium dioxide to meet
              specifications requiring such pigmentation for reduction of solar
              temperature gain.

            <h3>Uses</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a spray applied membrane to retain moisture in concrete for
                effective curing
              </li>
              <li>
                Suitable for all general concreting applications. Of particular
                benefit for large area concrete surfaces, such as airport
                runways, roads and bridgeworks

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Improved curing of concrete, enhances hydration process and
                provides a more durable concrete
              </li>
              <li>
                Control of moisture loss improves surface quality, reducing
                permeability, minimizing surface cracking and shrinkage.
              </li>
              <li>Fugitive colour provides visual guide during application.</li>
              <li>Also available in white pigmented grade.</li>
              <li>Water based, therefore, non-flammable.</li>
              <li>
                Spray application reduces labour costs, therefore eliminates the
                need for alternative curing systems.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Standards compliance</h3>
            <p>
              Strucure SW50 gives 75% or greater curing efficiency when tested
              to BS 7542 and complies with BS 8110 Part 1, clause 6.6.3(c), ASTM
              C309 and AASHTO M148 as Type 1D.

                <p>
                  Strucure SW50 has a minimum shelf life of 12 months at 35°C if
                  kept in a dry store in the original, unopened packs. The shelf
                  life will be reduced at higher ambient temperatures.

            <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strucure SW50 white should be stirred before use to ensure even
                dispersal of the pigment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Strucure SW50 should be spray applied to the surface of fresh
                concrete. Application should begin as soon as the concrete is
                free from surface water. Do not apply if bleed water is forming,
                or is present on the concrete surface.
              </li>
              <li>
                The spray nozzle should be held approximately 450 mm from the
                concrete surface and passed back and forth to ensure complete
                coverage. The fugitive white colour during application provides
                a guide to the area covered. Pump pressure should be maintained
                to give an even, fine spray.
              </li>
              <li>
                After spraying, no further application of water or other
                material is necessary to ensure continued curing. The concrete
                surface should not be disturbed until it has sufficient strength
                to bear surface loads. The applied film should not be trafficked
                until it is fully dry, care should also be taken to ensure that
                the film is not subsequently broken.
              </li>
              <li>
                Strucure SW50 may be applied to the surface of newly hardened
                concrete immediately after demoulding. In such cases the
                concrete surface must be damp and not dry. Dry surfaces may
                prevent correct film formation and cause absorption of the
                Strucure SW50 which may lead to staining and difficulty in later
                removal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spray equipment such as knapsack or motorized sprayers which
                produce a fine mist without damaging the emulsion may be used
                for Strucure SW50.

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strucure SW50 should not be continuously recirculated in high
                shear pumps in concrete train or similar applications, as this
                may cause a breakdown of the emulsion before spraying. If
                continuous recirculation is necessary, the sprayer should be
                fitted with a low shear diaphragm pump
              </li>
              <li>Minimum application temperature 5°C</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
            <p>
              Strucure SW50 is alkaline and should not come into contact with
              skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of dust during mixing. Gloves,
              goggles and dust mask should be worn. If contact with skin occurs,
              wash with water. Splashes to eyes should be washed immediately
              with plenty of clean water and medical advice sought.
