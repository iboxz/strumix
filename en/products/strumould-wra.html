            <p>
              Strumould WRA an emulsified blend of mineral oils and
              non-hazardous chemicals is specially formulated to produce release
              properties which are superior to those of conventional mould oils.
              Strumould WRA is supplied as a sprayable white liquid, ready for
              direct application on site. The chemically reactive components in
              Strumould WRA provide a water repellent interface which protects
              formwork and ensures an even colour and texture in the cast
              concrete. In addition to preventing adhesion of concrete to
              formwork, Strumould WRA will allow air to escape from the
              interface during concrete placing and vibration. The release of
              air minimizes surface blemishes and blow holes resulting in a
              substantial reduction in remedial costs.

                <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
                <p>
                  Mould preparation: All moulds, new or used, must be cleaned of
                  surface deposits of rust, concrete, oil or other materials.
                  Inadequate cleaning may lead to surface blemishes due to the
                  adhering material. The use of a proprietary chemical degreaser
                  or acid cleaning with Struclean® CM11 is recommended. If only
                  limited use of the formwork is envisaged, new timber moulds
                  may be coated directly with Strumould WRA. If forms are to be
                  regularly re-used then the surface should initially be coated
                  with a suitable polyurethane sealer. This provides increased
                  protection to the timber surface, improves ease of cleaning
                  and prevents the build up of large residual levels of release
                  agent in the timber of the form which may lead, over time, to
                  increased surface dusting or retardation.
                </p>
                <h3>Application</h3>
                <p>
                  Strumould WRA can be applied by all normal methods, including
                  brush, sponge and conventional spray. Where suitable, spray
                  application is recommended. Non-absorbent surfaces require a
                  single application. New, unsealed, timber surfaces should be
                  re-coated if delay in use of the mould leads to absorption of
                  the release agent into the timber. Coverage rate: Depending on
                  the porosity and texture of the mould surface, typical
                  coverage rates of 20 to 50 m2/litre will be obtainable. Best
                  results will be obtained with the thinnest practical coating.
                  Over application should be avoided. Excessive application on
                  flat surfaces or which leads to pooling of release agent in
                  the corners of forms is uneconomic and can lead to surface
                  dusting or, in worst cases, surface retardation.

            <h3>Packaging &amp; Storage</h3>
            <p>
              Strumould WRA is available in 20 Litr containers and 208 Litr
              drums. Strumould WRA has a minimum shelf life of 12 months when
              stored in the original unopened containers under normal warehouse
              conditions.
            </p>
            <h3>After stripping or demoulding</h3>
            <p>
              After use, the formwork or mould should be brushed or wiped clean
              of any excess dust prior to re-application of Strumould WRA for
              the next use of the mould. The use of Strumould WRA minimizes the
              amount of time and effort required for this process.
            </p>
            <h3>Repair of moulds</h3>
            <p>
              If, after extended use, mould surfaces require repair or recoating
              with polyurethane sealer, all residual traces of Strumould WRA
              must be removed to ensure complete adhesion. This is best effected
              by using a strong industrial detergent together with stiff
              brushing, followed by thorough rinsing with clean water.

            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
            <p>
              Strumould WRA does not fall into the hazard classifications of
              current regulations. However, it should not be swallowed or
              allowed to come into contact with skin and eyes. Suitable
              protective gloves and goggles should be worn. Splashes on the skin
              should be removed with water. In case of contact with eyes rinse
              immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice. If
              swallowed seek medical attention immediately - do not induce
              vomiting
