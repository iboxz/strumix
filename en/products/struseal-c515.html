              Struseal C515 is a high-strength concrete replacement mortar that
              is impermeable to pressurized water by crystalline waterproofing
              technology which is used to repair damaged areas of concrete,
              cracks, joints, tie holes, and honeycombed areas. Struseal C515
              contains active materials to protect concrete against water,
              chloride, sulfate ingress, and any other chemical attack.

            <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Preparation: It is essential that the substrate to be repaired
                is sound, clean and free of all contamination. The damaged areas
                of concrete to be removed must be clearly identified. The
                Perimeter of the area should be saw cut to a depth of 10 mm and
                the edges cut as neatly as possible keeping the sides square.
                Feather-edging is not permitted and a minimum thickness of 10 mm
                must be maintained over the whole area. The substrate should be
                prepared to provide a rough surface having at least 5 mm
                amplitude at 20 mm frequency. If unsound or oil contaminated
                concrete is found to extend beyond the pre-marked area, consult
                the engineer in charge. Subject to approval cut back to clean
                sound concrete. If reinforcement is corroded, ensure that the
                back of the steel has been exposed. Reinforcement should have
                all rust removed by the use of power tools, abrasive basting
                (wet or dry) or wire brushing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Water Saturation: Thoroughly saturate the surface of the
                concrete to provide a saturated surface dry condition. Poor
                quality concrete may require soaking for a significant length of
                time. Any surface water should be removed using an oil free
                compressed air-jet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mixing: Struseal C515 should be mixed mechanically with a Heavy
                Duty, slow speed drill or a forced action mixer fitted. Add 3
                liters of water into a suitably sized mixing vessel for full bag
                mixing. Do not use part-bags. It is suggested that the
                temperature of the water should not exceed 20°C, so that the
                temperature of the final mixed material is not greater than
                30°C. With the mixer in action, add one full bag of Struseal
                C515 and mix for 3 - 5 minutes, until the mix becomes fully
                homogeneous. (Water levels may be adjusted to allow good spray
                techniques between 3 &amp; 3.5 liters per bag)
              </li>
              <li>
                Application: After mixing, Struseal C515 can be sprayed or
                trowel applied. When applying by hand, Struseal C515 must be
                forced tightly into the substrate to ensure intimate contact
                with the pre-wetted substrate. Leveling and initial finishing
                should be carried using a wooden or plastic float. Final
                finishing should be carried out using a steel float. When the
                material has stiffened to the point where finger pressure
                lightly marks the surface, a final firm troweling should be
                given using a steel float.
              </li>
              <li>
                Curing: Struseal C515 demands good curing. Particular care is
                required in hot/windy conditions. Curing is to be commenced
                immediately either by applying a single coat of Strubond@ Acro7
                or by covering the work with plastic sheet fixed over wet
                hessian and taped at all edges.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleaning: Struseal C515 should be removed from tools and
                equipment with clean water immediately after use.
              </li>

            <h3>Packaging &amp; Storage</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Packaging: Struseal C515 is available in 25 kg bags.</li>
              <li>
                Storage: Struseal C515 has a minimum shelf life of 12 months at
                20°C if kept in a dry store in the original, unopened packs. The
                shelf life will be reduced at higher ambient temperatures.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
            <p>
              Struseal C515 is alkaline and should not come into contact with
              skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of dust during mixing. Gloves,
              goggles and dust mask should be worn. If contact with skin occurs,
              wash with water. Splashes to eyes should be washed immediately
              with plenty of clean water and medical advice sought.
