            <p>
              Strutop Gard-PA is supplied as a ready to use blend of dry powders
              which requires only the site addition of clean water to produce a
              highly consistent, rapid setting mortar which is easy to apply in
              many difficult conditions. The material is based on a blend of
              cements, graded aggregates, special fillers and chemical additives
              which control the rate of set and minimize the risk of thermal
              cracking. Strutop Gard-PA provides an initial set time of
              approximately one minute.

              <div>
                <h4>Instructions for use</h4>
                <p>
                  Preparation: Areas to be patched should be cut back to a depth
                  of 15 mm and given a good mechanical key. Feather-edges must
                  not be allowed. Surface should be brushed clean to remove
                  loose material, dust and laitance. Grease, slime or mould
                  growth should be removed by steam cleaning or high-pressure
                  water jetting. A proprietary degreasing agent should be used
                  for removal of light oil or grease contamination. To seal
                  leaks, crack openings must be chased out to approximately 20
                  mm square. The chase should always be undercut to avoid
                  leaving a v-section. All loose material and debris should be
                  removed.
                </p>
                <h4>Mixing</h4>
                <p>
                  Strutop Gard-PA should be added to clean water in the
                  following proportions: One part clean water: 3 parts Strutop
                  Gard-PA (measured by volume). Mix to a stiff consistency in a
                  suitable mixing drum or bucket, using a trowel or gloved hand.
                  Due to the rapid set characteristics of the product, only
                  prepare a quantity of mortar which can be placed within the
                  prescribed set time.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Application</h4>
                <p>
                  Trowel apply or hand-knead the mixed mortar in place, ensuring
                  maximum contact with the substrate before the material sets.
                  If being used to plug running water, Strutop Gard-PA should be
                  used and held in place until the initial set is reached. Note:
                  The minimum applied thickness of Strutop Gard-PA should be 15
                  mm.
                </p>
                <h4>Cleaning</h4>
                <p>
                  Strutop Gard-PA products should be removed from tools,
                  equipment and mixers with clean water prior to the initial
                  set. Cured material can only be removed mechanically.
